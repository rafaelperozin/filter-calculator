# Filter per m²/ft² using calculator

I developed this to filter products on the category page using "What's in your budget" form.

The idea is to refine the product list results by m² or ft² and considering the value that fit the user pocket.

The user just needs to fill the budget and area of their roof and the calculator discover the m² limit price that user can spend on the store and make the filter.

This is for a Magento 1.9 store and I had some limits of languages version. Then I used jQuery and ES5 to guarantee that will works on all devices and browsers.
