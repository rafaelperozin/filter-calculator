# Filter per m²/ft² using calculator

"What's in your budget?" filter for an e-commerce category page.
The idea is filtering the product list results by m² or ft².
The user just needs to fill the budget and area of their roof and the calculator discover the m² limit price that user can spend on the store and make the filter.

This is for a Magento 1.9 store and I had some limits of languages version. Then I used jQuery and ES5 to guarantee that will works on all devices and browsers.
